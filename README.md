Compass
=======

An orienteering application ported from Qt to Windows Phone. This example app
combines Nokia Maps with compass sensor. A custom user control, which has an
appearance of an orienteering compass, can be manipulated with gestures; it can
be dragged and rotated. In addition, the bearing component within the control
can also be rotated.
